## 1. What is VasoolBook?

VasoolBook is a loan and collection management app for finance businesses and individual collection agents. It replaces the paper "vasool" notebook: you organise borrowers into **collections** (collection lines/routes), give **loans**, and record **EMI payments** as you collect them — with automatic balance tracking, due-date tracking, receipts, reports, and backups.

- Works fully offline; data is stored on your phone
- Available in 6 app languages: English, தமிழ், हिंदी, తెలుగు, ಕನ್ನಡ, മലയാളം
- Optional Google Drive backup keeps your data safe

## 2. Core Concepts & App Flow

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Organization** | Your business — name, phone, logo, currency. Appears on receipts and PDFs. |
| **Collection** | A group/line of customers collected on the same cycle (e.g., "Market Street Daily"). Defines the type (daily/weekly/monthly…), interest rate, and default installment count. |
| **Customer** | A borrower inside a collection — name, phone, photo, address, GPS location. |
| **Loan** | Money given to a customer. The app calculates interest, total amount, EMI amount, and due dates from the collection settings. |
| **EMI / Installment** | One repayment. Recording it updates the repaid amount, balance, and next due date automatically. The loan closes itself when the balance reaches zero. |

### App flow

```mermaid

    A[First launch] --> B[Welcome & walkthrough]
    B --> C[Company details setup]
    C --> D[Dashboard]
    B -- "Have a backup?" --> R[Restore from zip] --> D
    D --> E[Collection]
    E --> F[Customer]
    F --> G[Loan]

    I -- No --> H
    D --> K[Daily Collection Tracker]
    D --> L[Bulk Update]
    E --> M[Reports / CashFlow / Customer Map]
```

**A typical day with VasoolBook:** open the app → the Dashboard shows what's due and overdue → open the Daily Collection Tracker or a collection → collect and record EMIs door-to-door (the Customer Map can guide you) → share receipts by WhatsApp/SMS or print them → note the day's cash in the CashFlow Book → your Google Drive auto-backup runs daily.

---

## 3. Getting Started

### First launch

1. Open the app. You'll see the **Welcome** screen with a 3-page walkthrough (swipe to browse).
2. Options here:
   - **Watch App Demo** — opens a video tutorial (in Tamil) on YouTube.
   - **Let's get Started** — continues to company setup.
   - **Already have a backup? click here to Restore** — pick a VasoolBook backup `.zip` and all your data is restored.
3. On first launch the app also asks for **Notifications** and **Camera** permission (used for EMI reminders and customer photos).

### Company details (Organization setup)

*[Screenshot: Company Details screen]*

1. Add your **company logo** (optional) — picked from the gallery and cropped square. It appears on loan PDFs.
2. Enter **Company Name** (required) and **Phone Number** (required, exactly 10 digits).
3. Optionally add E-mail, Address, and **Terms and Conditions** (printed on loan PDFs).
4. Choose your **Currency** from the list.
5. Tap **Save Company Details**. You land on the Dashboard — setup is complete and won't be asked again.

You can edit company details anytime from **Settings → Company Details**.

---

## 4. Dashboard

*[Screenshot: Dashboard]*

The Dashboard is home base. From top to bottom:

- **Top bar** — your organization name, plus three buttons: **Contact Support**, **Plans/Upgrade**, and **Settings**.
- **Collection Alert widget** — appears when loans are overdue or due today ("N loans overdue"). Tap it to open the **Daily Collection Tracker**.
- **Gross Balance card** — total outstanding balance of all active loans, split by collection type with a proportional bar. The **Export** button here exports your data (Diamond plan).
- **All Collections (N)** — your collections list with a **sort menu** (Name A–Z / Z–A, Creation oldest/newest — remembered) and a **Bulk Update** shortcut (Diamond plan).
- **Search** — appears automatically once you have 5 or more collections; searches by collection name or area.
- **Collection cards** — name, area, active loan count, and outstanding balance. The corner badge shows the collection day (for weekly types) or the type. Tap to open the collection.
- **New Collection** button — creates a collection (Base plan allows up to 5; Premium/Diamond unlimited).

> **Privacy Mode:** when enabled (see [Security](#14-security)), all amounts on the Dashboard and trackers show as `* * * * *`.

---

## 5. Collections

A collection defines *how* a group of customers repays.

### Collection types

| Type | EMI cycle | Interest calculation | End date |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Daily** | Every day | `loan amount × rate ÷ 100` (flat, up-front) | start + installments (days) |
| **Weekly** | Every week (pick a collection day) | same as Daily | start + installments (weeks) |
| **Bi-Weekly** | Every 2 weeks (pick a day) | same as Daily | start + installments × 2 (weeks) |
| **Custom Weekly** | Every week (pick a day) | `rate × installments` (rate is the amount per 100 per installment) | start + installments (weeks) |
| **Monthly** | Every month | `rate × installments` | start + installments (months) |
| **Monthly (Interest)** | Every month | Interest-only EMIs: each EMI = the interest amount; the principal stays as the balance until settled | start + installments (months) |

> **Monthly (Interest)** collections require the Premium plan, and are not available in Bulk Update.

### Create a collection

1. Dashboard → **New Collection**.
2. Enter **Collection Name** and **Area Name**.
3. Pick the **Collection Type**; for weekly types also pick the **Collection Day** (Monday–Sunday).
4. Set the **Interest Rate (amount per 100)**, optional **Processing Fees**, whether to **Take Interest at Start** (interest deducted from the amount handed over), and the default **number of installments**.
5. Add **Notes** if needed and **Save**. New loans in this collection pre-fill these values (you can still change them per loan).

### Inside a collection

*[Screenshot: Collection Details screen]*

- **Header card** — today's summary, gross balance, an **eye button** to hide/show amounts (passcode-protected if Passcode Lock is on), and **View CashFlow** (Premium).
- **Top bar** — **Customer Map** button (Diamond), **Reports** button (Premium), and a **⋮ menu**: Edit Collection, Delete Collection, **Reorder Customers** (Diamond — drag customers into your door-to-door route order), Reports.
- **Tabs** — Active / Inactive / All customers.
- **Filter chips** (Active tab) — **All · n**, **Due Today · n**, **Overdue · n** with live counts. Tap to filter the list.
- **Sort** — the sort button offers Custom Order (your reorder), Name A–Z, Name Z–A. The choice is remembered per collection.
- **Search** — the magnifier expands a search box (always visible on Inactive/All tabs).
- **Customer cards** — photo, name, area, phone (tap the phone icon to call), loan amount, EMI, due date, and pending balance. A **+** button records an EMI directly from the list (Premium).
- **New Customer** button — Base plan allows 20 customers per collection; Premium/Diamond unlimited.

---

## 6. Customers

### Add a customer

1. Open a collection → **New Customer**.
2. Add a **photo** (camera or gallery, cropped) — optional.
3. Enter **Customer Name** (required), phone, e-mail, address.
   - Use the **import-from-contacts** button in the top bar to fill name/phone from your phonebook.
4. **Customer Location** — tap the field to open the **map picker**:
   - Pan the map under the red center pin, or
   - **Search** a city/area/landmark, or
   - Tap the **my-location** button to jump to where you're standing (asks location permission once).
   - Tap **Confirm Location**. The coordinates appear in the field; ✕ clears them.
5. **SMS notifications** toggle — when on (and a phone number exists), the app offers WhatsApp/SMS receipts after loans and EMIs.
6. **Save Customer Details**.

### Customer details screen

*[Screenshot: Customer Details]*

- Profile card: photo, name, phone, address, and **Navigate to customer location** *(Diamond)* — opens turn-by-turn directions in your maps app when a location is saved.
- Loan overview for the active loan: progress bar, Total/Paid/Balance tiles, EMI amount and next due date, repayment history, and the **Repayment Schedule**.
- Top bar: **share** and **download** the loan statement PDF (Premium), and a **⋮ menu**: Edit Customer, **Edit Loan**, Delete Customer, Delete Loan.
- **Add EMI** button at the bottom records a payment.
- Customers with no active loan show **New Loan** instead.

---

## 7. Loans

### Create a loan

1. Customer details → **New Loan**.
2. The form pre-fills from the collection (interest rate, installments, charges). Enter the **Loan Amount** and adjust anything needed, including the start date.
3. Tap **Calculate** to preview: amount given, total interest, total to repay, EMI amount, and the end date.
4. **Save**. If the customer has a phone number and SMS enabled, a **Send Receipt** sheet offers WhatsApp / SMS / Print.

The math in brief: interest is computed per the collection type (see the table in [Collections](#5-collections)); if "interest at start" is on, the interest is deducted from the cash handed over; EMI = total ÷ installments.

### Manage a loan

- **Edit Loan** (⋮ menu on customer details) — change amounts/rate/installments; recalculates while **preserving the repaid amount and current due date**. The app blocks a new total lower than what's already repaid.
- **Close Loan** — mark it settled manually (it also closes automatically at zero balance).
- **Closed loans** — every customer's past loans are listed under View Closed Loans, with PDF share/download (Premium).
- **Repayment Schedule** — full installment table; share it as a PDF from the top bar.

---

## 8. Collecting EMIs

You can record a payment four ways:

### a) From the customer screen
Customer details → **Add EMI** → date (defaults to today), amount (capped at the balance), and Cash/**Online** payment mode → Save. Balance, repaid amount, and the next due date update automatically; the loan closes at zero balance. A receipt sheet follows (if the customer has SMS enabled).

### b) Quick-pay from the collection list *(Premium)*
Tap the **+** on a customer card in the collection list — same EMI sheet without leaving the list.

### c) Daily Collection Tracker
Dashboard alert widget or **Settings → Daily Collection Tracker**.

*[Screenshot: Today's Collection screen]*

- **Collected vs Target** progress for today.
- **Overdue EMIs** (red) and **Today's Due EMIs** lists — each row shows the customer, collection, EMI amount, and due date with a **Collect** button that opens the EMI sheet.

### d) Bulk Update *(Diamond)*
Dashboard → **Bulk Update** chip:

1. Pick the **date** (top bar) and the **collection** (Monthly-Interest collections are excluded).
2. Every active loan is listed with a pre-filled EMI amount (toggle **Pre-fill EMI Amount** in the ⋮ menu). Adjust amounts, choose Cash/Online per row, and select customers individually or with **Select All**.
3. The bottom bar totals your selection — tap **Update Entries** → confirm. All installments are saved in one shot.

---

## 9. Customer Map *(Diamond)*

*[Screenshot: Customer Map with pins]*

Open a collection → the **location icon** in the top bar.

- Every customer with a saved location appears as a **red pin with their name** on an OpenStreetMap view.
- The map auto-frames all pins; the **⛶ button** re-frames anytime. The bottom chip counts customers on the map.
- **Tap a pin** → a card with the customer's name, **current balance**, and **Open in Maps** (shows the spot in your maps app). Tap elsewhere to dismiss.

3. Review **Total Income / Total Expense** and the **Closing Balance**.
4. Add an optional **note** and Save.

Entries are listed by date with income, expense, opening/closing balances, and your note. Swipe right to edit, left to delete.

### Collection reports *(Premium for PDF download; opens from collection details → Reports)*

*[Screenshot: Monthly report calendar]*

---

## 12. Receipts & Thermal Printing

### WhatsApp / SMS receipts
After creating a loan or recording an EMI (for customers with a phone number and SMS enabled), the **Send Receipt** sheet offers:

3. Once enabled *and connected*, a **Print Receipt** option appears in the Send Receipt sheet after loans and EMIs.

## 14. Security

All under **Settings** and **Settings → User Preferences**:

- **Biometric Lock** (Settings → Security) — require fingerprint/face (or device PIN) every time the app opens.

## 18. Troubleshooting & FAQ

**The map is blank / pins don't load.**
Map tiles need internet the first time. Check your connection; previously viewed areas work offline.

**"Use current location" fails.**
Grant location permission, turn GPS on, and try in an open area. Indoors the app falls back to your last known location.

**Auto-backup isn't running.**
It requires the Diamond plan, a connected Google Drive account, the toggle enabled, and internet. Backups run once per day.

**The print option doesn't appear after saving a loan/EMI.**
Thermal printing must be **enabled** in Settings → Thermal printer *and* a printer must be currently connected. Also, the receipt sheet only appears for customers with a phone number and SMS notifications enabled.

**I can't turn Privacy Mode / Biometric Lock off.**
Passcode Lock is on — enter your 4-digit passcode. Forgot it? Contact support.

**A customer paid more than the EMI / paid early.**
Enter any amount up to the balance when adding an EMI — the schedule and due date adjust automatically.

**I edited a loan — what happens to old payments?**
Nothing. Recorded installments are preserved; the app recalculates the balance as new total − already repaid, and blocks totals lower than the repaid amount.

**How do I move to a new phone?**
Old phone: Settings → BackUp & Restore → Download Backup (or Backup & Share). New phone: install → Welcome screen → Restore → pick the `.zip`.

**Something else?**
Settings → **Contact Support** — email (reply within 24 hours), WhatsApp group, and a Tamil demo video.

¹ *Saving* a customer's location (the map picker on the customer form) is available on every plan; *viewing* locations — the Customer Map and the navigate shortcut — requires Diamond.
