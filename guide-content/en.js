<p>VasoolBook is a loan and collection management app for finance businesses and individual collection agents. It replaces the paper "vasool" notebook: you organise borrowers into <strong>collections</strong> (collection lines/routes), give <strong>loans</strong>, and record <strong>EMI payments</strong> as you collect them — with automatic balance tracking, due-date tracking, receipts, reports, and backups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Works fully offline; data is stored on your phone</li>
<li>Available in 6 app languages: English, தமிழ், हिंदी, తెలుగు, ಕನ್ನಡ, മലയാളം</li>
<li>Optional Google Drive backup keeps your data safe</li>

<h3>Create a loan</h3>
<ol>
<li>Customer details → <strong>New Loan</strong>.</li>

<li>Tap <strong>Calculate</strong> to preview: amount given, total interest, total to repay, EMI amount, and the end date.</li>
<li><strong>Save</strong>. If the customer has a phone number and SMS enabled, a <strong>Send Receipt</strong> sheet offers WhatsApp / SMS / Print.</li>
</ol>
<p>The math in brief: interest is computed per the collection type (see the table in the Collections section); if "interest at start" is on, the interest is deducted from the cash handed over; EMI = total ÷ installments.</p>

<h3>Manage a loan</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit Loan</strong> (⋮ menu on customer details) — change amounts/rate/installments; recalculates while <strong>preserving the repaid amount and current due date</strong>. The app blocks a new total lower than what's already repaid.</li>
<li><strong>Close Loan</strong> — mark it settled manually (it also closes automatically at zero balance).</li>
<li><strong>Closed loans</strong> — every customer's past loans are listed under View Closed Loans, with PDF share/download <span class="badge premium">Premium</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Repayment Schedule</strong> — full installment table; share it as a PDF from the top bar.</li>
